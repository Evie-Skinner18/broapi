Please create a branch/fork from master, add bro names to the list, and submit the PR. Label them as BroName and Hacktoberfest too!

There are three simple rules:  
1. Bro names are a play on the original name with bro in it. Not just randomly added into it but creatively integrated. This rule is kind of subjective. Be creative and not lazy.  
      
  * For example:  
	* Abroham Lincoln is a clever play on the name. This would be accepted.  
	* Abraham Lincolnbro is just lazy and is not very clever. This would not be accepted.  
	
2.  The bro name is not a repeat  
3.  The bro name does not break JSON syntax.
